Start with 10 dice. You roll all. 
1's are worth 100, 5's are worth 50. 
a run (1 through 6) is worth 1500 (must all be in one roll). 
3 1's is 1000. 
4 of any other number is 1000. 
5 of any number is 2000 (including ones). 
6 of any number is 3000 (including ones). 
7 of any number is 4000 (including ones). 
8 of any number is 5000 (including ones). 
9 of any number is 6000 (including ones). 
10 of any number is 7000 (including ones). 
3 2's is 200
3 3's is 300
3 4's is 400
3 5's is 500
3 6's is 600
roll and you've got to get some points, otherwise you zilch. 
if you keep all 10, then you lock, and you get roll again and get more points. 
first to 20,000 wins, except first to 20,000, then everyone else gets one more turn. 
each person decides to roll all 10, or roll free dice from the earlier turn, and get all points of earlier player plus anything that counts. 
each player decides which dice to count versus roll.
