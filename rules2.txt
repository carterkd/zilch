### **Gameplay**

#### **Rolling and Scoring**
1. **Start of Turn:**
   - Players can either:
     - Roll all 10 dice fresh, OR
     - Build off the previous player’s turn by rolling the free dice that the previous player did not score.

2. **Scoring Rules:**
   - After rolling, identify scoring dice (1's, 5's, triples, straights, etc.).
   - You must set aside at least one scoring die or scoring group per roll.
   - Dice that could score but are not set aside are considered "free dice" and may be re-rolled.

3. **Building Off the Previous Turn:**
   - If a player builds off the previous player’s turn, they inherit the previous player’s locked points.
   - Example: If the previous player locked 2,000 points, scored 400 additional points with four dice, and stopped, the next player can roll the 6 free dice. If the new player scores with these dice without zilching, their points will be added to 2,400 (the previous total).

4. **Re-Rolling Free Dice:**
   - Continue rolling free dice until:
     - You choose to stop and bank your points, OR
     - You set aside all 10 dice and "lock," allowing you to roll all 10 dice again, OR
     - You zilch (fail to roll any scoring dice).

---

#### **Zilching**
- If you roll and no dice score, you zilch.
- A zilch ends your turn, and you lose all unbanked points earned during that turn.
- **Important:** If a player zilches, the next player **must roll all 10 dice fresh** and cannot build on the previous player's turn.

---

#### **Locking Points**
- When you use all 10 dice for scoring, you "lock" your points.
- Locked points cannot be lost, even if you later zilch during re-rolls.

---

### **Winning the Game**
- The first player to reach 20,000 points triggers the final round.
- Each remaining player gets one last turn to try and exceed that score.
- The player with the highest score after the final round wins.

---

### **Additional Notes**
1. **Dice Selection:**
   - Players can decide which scoring dice to set aside and which potentially scoring dice to re-roll as free dice.
   - For example, you may choose to re-roll a single 1 (worth 100 points) instead of setting it aside.

2. **Carrying Over Points:**
   - Points from previous players’ locked and unzilched turns are carried forward when rolling free dice.

---

### **Example Turns**

#### **Example 1: Successful Turn**
1. Player A rolls all 10 dice and gets: 1, 1, 5, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 6, 6.
2. Player A sets aside:
   - Two 1's (200 points), the 5 (50 points), and three 2's (200 points), scoring 450 points.
   - The remaining 4 dice are free dice.
3. Player A rolls the 4 free dice and scores 300 more points (e.g., a triple 3), bringing their total to 750 points.
4. Player A chooses to stop and bank their 750 points.

#### **Example 2: Building Off a Previous Turn**
1. Player B chooses to build off Player A’s turn.
2. Player B inherits 750 locked points and rolls the 6 free dice from Player A’s turn.
3. Player B scores with the 6 dice, adding their points to Player A’s 750.

#### **Example 3: Zilch**
1. Player C rolls all 10 dice and gets no scoring dice, resulting in a zilch.
2. Player C’s turn ends with no points.
3. **Player D must roll all 10 dice fresh**, as Player C’s zilch means there are no points to build on.
